# Welcome to Andrew's Portfolio and Blog!

I like to explore my wide range of interests and have decided to document my learning through a portfolio and blog. The portfolio centers around finished products for potential employers to view, while the blog describes my thought process while making those projects and my progress dabbling in other hobbies. I'm trying to learn about many fields at approximately the same time, so some sections will be more fleshed out than others.

For my portfolios, see the relevant tabs above for data science, GIS, and UI/UX. For a description of my learning process for both portfolio projects and other hobbies such as photography and ham radio, see the blog tab.

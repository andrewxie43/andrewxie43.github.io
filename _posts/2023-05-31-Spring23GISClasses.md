title: "Spring 2023 GIS Work"
---

For the Spring 2023 semester, I took GGIS 379 (Introduction to GIS) and GGIS 403 (Geographic Information Science and Systems) at UIUC as part of a certificate in GIS. This was my first semester learning anything about GIS, so most of the projects made were made following precise instructions given by the professor. A sample map made during this class can be found [in the relevant portfolio tab](andrewxie.dev/gis/gis-classwork).

Both classes were roughly similar in content, with GGIS 379 focusing more on ArcGIS Pro and layout creation and GGIS 403 focusing more on data analysis with QGIS. The classes were useful in introducing me to basic concepts and following detailed instructions to produce products, however I will need to experiment and do projects in my free time to better understand how to use GIS software. 

I'll be taking more classes in future semesters and hopefully experimenting on my own as well.
